# Github
## Getting Started
* Create an account on [Github](github.com)
* Install Git:
  * __Windows__: Install Git from [here](https://www.git-scm.com/download). This should also install Git Bash.
  * __Linux__: Install the ``` git ``` package using whatever package manager of your choice.
  * __Mac__: Git should already be installed!
* What is Git?
Git is used for version control. This means that it maintains a record of all the changes you've made to a file or directory.
### Version control excercise
> "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
1. Write the above sentence on a piece of paper.
2. Rewrite the above sentence, but make one change by adding, removing, or replacing a word in it.
3. Get with a couple of other people who have done these two steps. Now merge your changes into one sentence.
4. Everyone in the group copy this new sentence and make another change.
5. Merge everyone's changes together again.
### What does it mean?
What problems happened? Did multiple people change the same word? Did someone remove a word that someone else had replaced? What did you do to resolve these conflicts?

This is how the Git workflow goes.
